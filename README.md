# YouTube Downloader

Hello there so you have decided you want to do something apart from you college syllabus. Thats good now you task is to help me complete this project. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (Ofcourse)
- PyTube (A Python library to deal with YouTube)
- PySimpleGUI (A Python library to create GUIs)
- Brain (A human brain to understand the code)

to install the libraries run the following command:
```pip install pytube```
```pip install PySimpleGUI```

Don't do this:
```pip install brain```

## Whats in the box?

The project contains the following files:
- `main.py` - The main script
- `README.md` - This file you are reading now
- `youtueb.py` - A file that contains the code you need to build

I have made the GUI for you so you don't have to worry about it. Your task is to write the code that downloads the video. Please don't use Notepad(for god sake). Use a proper IDE like VSCode or PyCharm.

## How to start the project?

Go ahead and fork this repository. Then clone it to your local machine. Then open the project in your IDE. Then open the `youtube.py` file and start writing the code.
Once you are done with the code run the `main.py` file and see if it works. If it does not work then you have to fix it. If it works then you are good to go.
Send me a pull request and I will review your code. If it is good then I will merge it with the main branch.

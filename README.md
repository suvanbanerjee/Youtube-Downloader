Just dobule click the `main.pyw`

## Bonus Tip
If you want to add this project like a software in your PC then you can do so by creating a shortcut of the `launch.bat` file and then moving it to `C:\Users\{YouCoolUsername}\AppData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\` folder. This will make the program appear in Start Menu.

Linux Users make a .desktop file and move it to `/usr/share/applications/` folder (I hope you know how to do that. You use Linux bruh).
